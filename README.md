# Python Terminal Scrabble Game 

This Greek Python Scrabble game allows players (human or computer) to draw letters from a shared bag, form words, and score points based on letter values. The computer uses three algorithms to select words(max, min, smart), while the human player manually chooses words. The game includes input validation to ensure valid moves, checking if the player has the required letters and if the word exists in the dictionary(greek7.txt).


Here's a preview of the game:
